#Encoder
==========

This is a basic encoder app using Javascript.  The way it works is you can enter a secret message in the textbox.  Encrypt the message by clicking encyrpt and then entering a passcode to protect the message.  Afterwards you can access the encrypted message by clicking decrypt and entering the same passcode given to encrypt the message.
